# **gabrieleansani-website** ✨
In this repository you can find the code for my first project, my personal website. The website, written in **HTML** and **CSS**, consists of **4 pages** accessible via **sticky menu**, where the user can learn about me and my professional services.
In every page you can see the same **header** and **footer** and a similar layout, built with several grids and neutral colors to give greater stylistic and chromatic homogeneity across the entire site.
# **page 1 - index** 📍
Built like a **homepage**, on the index page the user can get to know me: who I am, what my job is, my educational background and my hobbies. The layout is constructed from a **series of alternating grids** to create a chessboard effect.
# **page 2 - cv** 📍
In this page the user can see my personal **cv**, so the main stages of my professional journey and my education. the layout is made up of a series of **grids**.
# **page 3 - contacts** 📍
Through the contact page the user can get in touch with me for the services he/she needs: by filling out the **form**, he/she can enter his/her personal data and also send a personal message.
# **page 4 - portfolio** 📍
The portfolio page has been inserted in the header but not yet built: it will be available with the publication of the first completed projects.
